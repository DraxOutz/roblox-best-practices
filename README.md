# 🛠️ Roblox Lua Learning Journey #

Welcome to my Roblox Lua Learning Repository!

This repository documents my progressive learning journey in Roblox Lua, showcasing how I improved my programming practices over time.
It’s designed to help other developers understand why certain techniques are useful and how small improvements can make code cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.

🎯 Goal

The main purpose of this repository is:

Share my learning process with the community.

Provide guidance for beginners and intermediate developers.

Document the evolution from basic scripts to well-structured, maintainable, and modular code.

Encourage best practices in Roblox Lua programming.

📈 What I Learned

During this journey, I improved on several key points:

Type Annotations (:string, :number, :Player)

Initially, I did not use them.

Now, they clarify the expected type of variables and function parameters.

Optional Parameters & Defaults (?)

Previously, I manually checked for nil.

Now, default values make the code cleaner and safer.

Type Casting (::)

Ensures that objects are treated as specific types.

Helps prevent runtime errors and improves readability.

Modular Design & Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Instead of mixing all logic in one script, I started splitting code into focused modules.

Each module does one thing only, making maintenance easier.

SOLID Principles

Learned to structure code in a way that is scalable, reusable, and easy to extend.

Better Documentation

Added clear comments and explanations.

Helps any developer understand the purpose of each module and function.

📝 Why This Matters

Readability – Clear, documented code is easier for anyone to understand.

Maintainability – Well-structured code reduces bugs and makes future improvements easier.

Learning Progression – Shows how small changes in style and structure can make a big difference.

Community Sharing – Others can follow my journey and learn from my mistakes and improvements.

💡 Notes

This repository is not just about code.
It’s about learning, understanding, and evolving as a Roblox developer.
I hope this helps other programmers clarify doubts, adopt better practices, and write cleaner, safer Lua scripts in Roblox.
