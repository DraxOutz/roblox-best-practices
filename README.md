# 📚 Roblox Lua Learning Modules #

## Welcome to my Roblox Lua Learning Repository! ##

This repository contains my step-by-step progression in learning clean, modular, and maintainable code for Roblox. Each file represents a lesson, showing how my coding style evolved.
The goal is to share knowledge and help other developers understand best practices in Roblox Lua.

## 🌟 Key Takeaways ##

- Progressive Learning: Each module builds on the previous one.
- Clean Code Practices: Focus on readability, modularity, and maintainability.
- Roblox Focused: Examples are practical and applicable in Roblox Lua development.
- Documentation: Each lesson is documented to help understand the purpose and usage.

## 💡 Why This Repository Exists ##

- To track progress from beginner patterns to advanced practices.
- To share insights with other developers.
- To showcase clean, maintainable Lua in Roblox.
- To encourage others to adopt better coding habits.

## 📌 Notes ##

- Modules are numbered to reflect learning order.
- Lessons focus on practical coding improvements, not just theory.
- This is meant for beginners and intermediate developers looking to level up in Roblox Lua.

## 🏋️ Object Calisthenics in Roblox Lua ##

This repository also follows Object Calisthenics principles, a set of nine rules designed to improve code quality by promoting cohesion, readability, and maintainability in object-oriented programming. These principles are applied in the lessons whenever possible:

- One dot per line: Avoid long chains like player:GetData():GetInventory():GetItem().
- No else keyword: Favor early returns and direct handling of cases.
- Small classes: Each class has a single responsibility.
- Small methods: Methods do one thing only.
- No primitives as members: Wrap values in objects for better encapsulation.
- Collections as objects: Do not expose raw tables; encapsulate them.
- Max 2 attributes per class: Forces cohesive and focused design.
- No getters/setters: Delegate responsibilities to objects themselves.
- Class names under two words: Short, clear, and meaningful.
